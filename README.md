# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to develop machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing various transaction features and patterns, we strive to identify anomalies that indicate suspicious behavior. The goal is to create a highly accurate detection system that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities, ultimately reducing financial losses and enhancing security for credit card users.

## Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses for both consumers and financial institutions. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze transaction data and detect fraudulent activities effectively.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this using the following commands:

```bash
!pip install opendatasets
!pip install pandas
!pip install scikit-learn
!pip install seaborn
!pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sathvika-891/CreditCardFraudPrediction.git
   cd CreditCardFraudPrediction
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

Sure! Here's the updated section for the README that includes information about downloading the dataset from Kaggle:

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains a variety of transaction features relevant for detecting fraudulent activities. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023).

## Models

We will explore several machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

Each model will be evaluated for its performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Evaluation

Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- AUC-ROC Curve

Visualizations will also be provided to demonstrate model effectiveness.
